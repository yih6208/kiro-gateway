# ===========================================
# LEGACY MODE (DEPRECATED)
# ===========================================

# Password to protect YOUR proxy server
# NOTE: This is deprecated in multi-tenant mode. Use the admin UI to generate API keys instead.
# This is NOT a token from anywhere - YOU make it up!
# Use this same value as api_key when connecting to your gateway
# Example: "my-super-secret-password-123" or any secure string
# PROXY_API_KEY="my-super-secret-password-123"

# ===========================================
# OPTION 1: Kiro IDE credentials (JSON file)
# ===========================================

# Path to JSON credentials file from Kiro IDE
# KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"

# ===========================================
# OPTION 2: Kiro IDE refresh token
# ===========================================

# Your Kiro refresh token obtained from Kiro IDE traffic.
# REFRESH_TOKEN="your_kiro_refresh_token_here"

# ===========================================
# OPTION 3: kiro-cli SQLite database (AWS SSO)
# ===========================================

# Path to kiro-cli SQLite database (for AWS IAM Identity Center users)
# The gateway will auto-detect AWS SSO OIDC and use the correct endpoint

# PROFILE_ARN="arn:aws:codewhisperer:us-east-1:..."

# ===========================================
# OPTIONAL
# ===========================================

# AWS region (default: us-east-1)

# ===========================================
# SERVER SETTINGS
# ===========================================

# Server host (default: 0.0.0.0 - listen on all interfaces)
# Use "127.0.0.1" to only allow local connections
# SERVER_HOST="0.0.0.0"

# Server port (default: 8000)
# Useful when port 8000 is already in use by another application
#
# Configuration priority (highest to lowest):
#   1. CLI arguments: python main.py --port 9000
#   2. Environment variables: SERVER_PORT=9000
#   3. Default value: 8000
#
# Note: When using `uvicorn main:app --port 9000` directly,
# uvicorn handles its own CLI arguments (this setting is ignored)
# SERVER_PORT="8000"

# ===========================================
# VPN/PROXY SETTINGS
# ===========================================

# VPN/Proxy URL for accessing Kiro API through a proxy server.
# Leave empty to connect directly (default).
#
# Use cases:
#   - China: GFW (Great Firewall) blocks AWS endpoints
#   - Corporate networks: Often require mandatory proxy
#   - Privacy: Hide your IP address from AWS
#
# Supports HTTP and SOCKS5 protocols.
# Authentication can be embedded in the URL.
#
# Examples:
#   VPN_PROXY_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7890"
#   VPN_PROXY_URL="socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
#   VPN_PROXY_URL="http://user:password@proxy.company.com:8080"
#   VPN_PROXY_URL="192.168.1.100:8080"  # defaults to http://
#
# VPN_PROXY_URL=""

# ===========================================
# FIRST TOKEN TIMEOUT (Streaming Retry)
# ===========================================

# Timeout for waiting for the first token from the model (in seconds).
# If the model doesn't respond within this time, the request will be cancelled and retried.
# This helps handle "stuck" requests when the model takes too long to start responding.
# Default: 15 seconds (recommended for production)
# Set a lower value (e.g., 5-10) for more aggressive retry behavior.
# FIRST_TOKEN_TIMEOUT="15"

# Maximum number of retry attempts when first token timeout occurs.
# After exhausting all attempts, a 504 Gateway Timeout error will be returned.
# Default: 3 attempts
# FIRST_TOKEN_MAX_RETRIES="3"

# Read timeout for streaming responses (in seconds).
# This is the maximum time to wait for data between chunks during streaming.
# Should be longer than FIRST_TOKEN_TIMEOUT since the model may pause between chunks
# while "thinking" (especially for tool calls or complex reasoning).
# Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - generous timeout to avoid premature disconnects.
# STREAMING_READ_TIMEOUT="300"

# ===========================================
# FAKE REASONING (Extended Thinking via Tag Injection)
# ===========================================

# Enable fake reasoning - injects special tags into requests to enable model reasoning.
# When enabled, the model will include its reasoning process in the response.
# The response is then parsed and converted to OpenAI-compatible reasoning_content format.
#
# WHY "FAKE"? This is NOT native extended thinking API support. Instead, we inject
# <thinking_mode>enabled</thinking_mode> tags into the prompt, and the model responds
# with <thinking>...</thinking> blocks that we parse and convert to reasoning_content.
# It works great, but it's a hack - hence "fake" reasoning.
#
# Default: true (ENABLED by default for premium experience out of the box)
# To disable, set to false:
# FAKE_REASONING=false

# Maximum thinking length in tokens.
# This value is injected into the request as <max_thinking_length>{value}</max_thinking_length>
# Higher values allow for more detailed reasoning but increase response time and token usage.
# Default: 4000 tokens
# FAKE_REASONING_MAX_TOKENS=4000

# How to handle the thinking block in responses:
# - "as_reasoning_content": Extract to reasoning_content field (OpenAI-compatible, recommended)
# - "remove": Remove thinking block completely, return only final answer
# - "pass": Pass through as-is with original tags in content
# - "strip_tags": Remove tags but keep thinking content in regular content
#
# Default: "as_reasoning_content"
# FAKE_REASONING_HANDLING=as_reasoning_content

# Maximum size of initial buffer for tag detection (characters).
# The parser buffers this many characters before deciding if response contains thinking tags.
# Lower values = faster first token appearance, but may miss tags with leading whitespace.
# Default: 20 characters (enough for longest tag <reasoning> = 11 chars + some whitespace)
# FAKE_REASONING_INITIAL_BUFFER_SIZE=20

# ===========================================
# TRUNCATION RECOVERY
# ===========================================

# Enable automatic truncation recovery when Kiro API cuts off large responses.
# When the model generates large tool calls or content, the upstream API may truncate
# the response mid-stream. This feature automatically notifies the model about truncation,
# allowing it to adapt its approach (e.g., write smaller files, split operations).
#
# Default: true (ENABLED by default for better out-of-the-box experience)
# TRUNCATION_RECOVERY=true

# ===========================================
# LOGGING
# ===========================================

# Log level: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# Default: INFO (recommended for production)
# Set to DEBUG for detailed troubleshooting
# LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
# HTTP CONNECTION POOL SETTINGS
# ===========================================

# Maximum total connections in the pool.
# Increase this if you have many concurrent requests.
# Default: 100 (suitable for most use cases)
# Recommended for high concurrency: 200-500
# For 512MB RAM: 300 is safe
# HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS=100

# Maximum keep-alive connections (connections kept open for reuse).
# This is the real bottleneck for concurrent requests.
# Default: 20 (may be too low for high concurrency)
# Recommended: 50-150 depending on your traffic
# For 512MB RAM: 150 is safe
# HTTP_MAX_KEEPALIVE_CONNECTIONS=20

# Keep-alive connection expiry time in seconds.
# How long to keep idle connections open for reuse.
# Default: 30 seconds
# Recommended: 60 seconds (reduces connection overhead)
# HTTP_KEEPALIVE_EXPIRY=30.0

# Connection pool timeout in seconds (time to wait for available connection).
# Set to "none" to disable timeout (recommended to prevent PoolTimeout errors).
# Default: 30 seconds
# Recommended: "none" (no timeout) or very high value like 300
# HTTP_POOL_TIMEOUT=30.0

# ===========================================
# GLOBAL RATE LIMITING
# ===========================================
# Prevents 429 (Too Many Requests) errors from Kiro API by controlling request flow.

# Maximum concurrent requests to Kiro API
# Set to 0 to disable (unlimited concurrency)
# Default: 0 (disabled), Recommended: 10-20 to avoid 429 errors
# RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CONCURRENT=10

# Minimum interval between requests (seconds)
# Controls the rate at which requests are sent to Kiro API
# Set to 0 to disable (no throttling)
# Default: 0 (disabled), Recommended: 0.1-0.5 seconds
# Example: 0.2 = max 5 requests per second
# RATE_LIMIT_MIN_INTERVAL=0.2

# Global backoff duration when 429 is received (seconds)
# When any request receives 429, ALL requests will pause for this duration
# Set to 0 to disable (each request handles 429 independently)
# Default: 0 (disabled), Recommended: 5-10 seconds
# RATE_LIMIT_429_BACKOFF=5.0

# ===========================================
# DEBUG (for development only)
# ===========================================

# Debug logging mode:
# - off: disabled (default)
# - errors: save logs only for failed requests (4xx, 5xx) - recommended for troubleshooting
# - all: save logs for every request (overwrites on each request)
# DEBUG_MODE=off

# Directory for debug log files
# DEBUG_DIR="debug_logs"
